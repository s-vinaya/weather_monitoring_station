PROBLEMS :-
For the working people in factories , and patients in hospital , maintaining the humidity and temperature is much essential , increase in temperature in the factories like ceramic rolls, metal products , and glass industry, where the temperatures are very high and humidity is low , if humidity goes below it will affect the human body ,so monitoring the temperature and humidity levels are important In hospitals for wellbeing of patients who are in bed cannot walk

Solutions :-
In order to solve this problem came up with an idea of WEATHER MONITORING STATION, It will help to monitor the temperature and humidity levels with the help of raspberry pi, Temperature sensor , LCD , and Pressure sensor, Sensors send the data to Raspberry pi which process the data and display in LCD and also data will be backed up in cloud server, (Thing speak server) any fluctuation in temperature will be shown on LCD in graph representation that will alert users
